      content="This basically does the opposite of Blocky, which enables user to transform logical blocks into code. That means, this app transforms JS code into block constructions using the Blockly framework. This way, any obnoxious code, poorly-idented etc will be represented visually with blocks tied to each other, thus become much clearer to read and understand."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
